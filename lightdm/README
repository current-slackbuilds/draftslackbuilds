lightdm (cross-desktop display manager)

LightDM is a cross-desktop display manager that:
 - Runs display servers (e.g. X) where necessary.
 - Runs greeters to allow users to pick which user account and session type to use.
 - Allows greeters to perform authentication using PAM.
 - Runs session processes once authentication is complete.
 - Provides remote graphical login options.

You need to create a dedicated user and group to take control of the lightdm daemon after it is started.
groupadd lightdm
useradd -c 'LightDM Daemon' \
        -g lightdm \
        -d /var/lib/lightdm \
        -s /bin/false lightdm

To activate LightDM, add these lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.4

if [ -x /usr/sbin/lightdm ]; then
  exec /usr/sbin/lightdm
fi
