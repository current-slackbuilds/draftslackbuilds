gtksourceview

GtkSourceView is a GNOME library that extends GtkTextView, the standard GTK+
widget for multiline text editing. GtkSourceView adds support for syntax
highlighting, undo/redo, file loading and saving, search and replace, a
completion system, printing, displaying line numbers, and other features
typical of a source code editor.
