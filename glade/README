glade

Glade is a RAD tool to enable quick & easy development of user interfaces for
the Gtk+ toolkit and the GNOME desktop environment. The user interfaces
designed in Glade are stored in XML format, enabling easy integration with
external tools. This version of Glade (Glade-3) is a complete rewrite of the
original Glade codebase.
